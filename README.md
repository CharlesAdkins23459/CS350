# CS350

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
For this project, I was to use the TMP006 temperature sensor to read the room temperature (via I2C), an LED to indicate the output to the thermostat where LED on = heat on (via GPIO), two buttons to increase and decrease the set temperature (via GPIO interrupt), and the UART to simulate the data being sent to the server.

# What did you do particularly well?
I followed the directions well, even though most of them were outdated and incorrect.  The provided code was non-functioning, so I did a great job of recognizing that it was practically useless.

# Where could you improve?
I could improve in the area of being more resourceful when it comes to troubleshooting the errors found in the provided code.  

# What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
There were very few resources to help with this project, so I'm not sure what could be added.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Being persistent and hopeful are two skills from this project that will help me with other projects.  When nothing that was provided to me works as advertised, find new ways to get it to work or do my best and move on.

# How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I utilized inline comments, obvious naming conventions and tried to make the code reusable.
